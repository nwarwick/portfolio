  <h2>Who am I?</h2>
  <p>I am a Computer Science graduate from the University of Victoria with a passion for software/web development and
    design. I am always eager to learn new tools and techniques while working alongside motivated and like-minded
    people.</p>
  <p>When I'm not programming I enjoy short walks on the beach, hiking, camping, playing video games, or hanging out
    with friends!</p>

  <h2>What have I done?</h2>
  <p>Besides building this website, I have worked as a Software Engineer in a variety of environments ranging from
    game development, RnD for the Canadian government, medical services, and industrial automation. I have been
    fortunate enough to play a leadership role at a company while it grew from 20 people to over 300. This allowed me
    to learn from the wide variety of challenges experienced at different levels of scale.</p>
  <p>Over the years I have worked on various small side-projects which you can find <a href="/projects">here.</a></p>
