    <h2>What have I done?</h2>
    <p>Besides building this website, I have worked as a Software Engineer in a variety of environments ranging from game development, RnD for the Canadian government, medical services, and industrial automation. I have been fortunate enough to play a leadership role at a company while it grew from 20 people to over 300. This allowed me to learn from the wide variety of challenges experienced at different levels of scale.</p>
    <p>Over the years I have worked on various small side-projects which you can find <a href="/projects">here.</a> When I'm not programming I enjoy short walks on the beach, hiking, camping, playing video games, or hanging out with friends!</p>
